Grubdash is an online platform that allows you to add all sorts of different meals to a single cart and get that for delivery.

This file constructed the back-end of the application so that you can reference a database with a variety of dishes and add them to orders.

The error handlers return the correct code of the error in case the user gets the wrong endpoint or one of the functions does not end up working correctly or if something arbitrary goes wrong.
